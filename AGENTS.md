# Agent instructions — Football Intelligence

## Mission

Continue the user's master request in `docs/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` and the roadmap until the native Android project has a tested, honest implementation of its stated product goals. This is ongoing engineering work, not a request to stop after an audit, plan, or first APK. Inspect the current branch, the development log, the roadmap, recent commits, and CI before resuming. Record progress and the next concrete task in the development log so another session can continue without repeating work.

## Product constraints

- Keep the app native Android/Kotlin and local-first. Budget is $0: do not add paid APIs, subscriptions, hosted services, or a dependency that requires payment.
- Do not place real bets or connect bookmaker accounts. All app tickets are virtual.
- Use public data only under terms that allow the intended access. Do not scrape restricted services, bypass authentication/CAPTCHA, use leaked keys, or embed secrets.
- Attribute sources and record data provenance, event time, and capture time where relevant. Never invent fixtures, quotes, tipster records, or model quality.
- Prevent temporal leakage. A forecast may only use information available before its forecast cutoff. Label uncalibrated or unvalidated experimental estimates clearly.
- Preserve existing user data and the existing Android app unless a documented reason justifies a migration.

## Working practices

- Make progress directly in the repository; do not return only a plan while implementation remains feasible.
- For each substantial milestone, update the code, tests, relevant documentation, and `docs/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`; run the appropriate tests and APK build; inspect the result; then create an explanatory Git commit. The user authorized work on and pushes to the linked GitHub repository. Verify GitHub Actions before calling the milestone CI-verified.
- Keep `README.md`, `docs/ROADMAP_RU.md`, `docs/LIMITATIONS.md`, and `docs/CHANGELOG.md` aligned with actual behavior. Keep `docs/DATA_SOURCES.md` and `docs/RESEARCH.md` explicit about licensing, access, and evidence.
- Do not claim success for checks that were not run. Do not present ROI, consensus, EV, or model probabilities as evidence of future profit.
- Prefer small, reviewable changes that fit a single-device app. Extract presentation/domain/data boundaries incrementally; do not add infrastructure without need.

## Current continuation point

Read `docs/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` for the latest verified commits and active milestone. The analytics foundation and the experimental Elo baseline are committed. Commit `63eedc1` passed local tests/build and GitHub Actions run `42708351125` (tests + debug APK artifact). Continue with timestamp-safe historical evaluation/import work; keep the roadmap and development log current as each milestone advances.
